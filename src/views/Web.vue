              About 3.8 billion people are online every day. From sharing content to collecting data
              for organizational purposes, there are about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data being
              processed by Google every day. Not all data is available to all people around the
              world. For example, a show on Netflix in one country may not be available in another
              country. This is due to restrictions and copyrights imposed by the government of the
              respective country. Web proxy is the easiest way to access all restricted content
              without having to install any kind of software.&nbsp;

                  <strong>What does a web proxy do?</strong>
                  <p>
                    Aweb proxy acts as an intermediary between the user and the internet. Taking a
                    request from the user to the targeted website,&nbsp; receiving the response, and
                    routing it back to the user.&nbsp;

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>When is the best time to use a web proxy?</strong>
                  <p>
                    Based on your needs. If you don't want to install software on your local
                    computer, with the help of a web proxy, you can simply type in the website
                    address and get the result.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Does a web proxy affect internet performance?</strong>
                  <p>
                    No, a web proxy uses cache memory, which stores the data temporarily about the
                    webpage you visited. If you want to visit that webpage again, the web proxy
                    provides you with a copy of the webpage, which reduces the latency.
                  </p>

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>
