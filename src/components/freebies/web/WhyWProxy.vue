  <h2>Why Do You Need a Web Proxy?</h2>
  <p>
    For an average user, a web proxy helps to access the restricted content behind geoblocking in
    websites and streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. This is carried out without
    compromising the internet connectivity speed. With ProxyScrape, you can surf restricted websites
    without annoying ads and other constraints. Simply paste the URL or type the website name and
    you will be directed to the website home page. It's that quick and simple.&nbsp;

    The second aspect of the need for web proxy is to improve network performance. For example, let
    us say that you visited an XYZ website in the morning. The web proxy saves the data from the
    webpage temporarily, so when you visit it again in early noon, it actually serves you a copy of
    the webpage and reduces the latency.
