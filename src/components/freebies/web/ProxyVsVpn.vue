  <h2>The Difference between Web Proxy and VPN</h2>
  <p>
    Web proxy servers and VPNs both act as an intermediary between the user and a website. Web
    proxies and VPNs both receive a request from the user, get a response from the targeted
    websites, and route it to the user again. The main differences between proxy servers and VPNs
    are how they work and which protocols they support, which affects their privacy and security
    capabilities.

    VPNs are typically configured at a system level, allowing all traffic to pass through them,
    i.e., web browsing, music streaming, file sharing, or gaming. Many VPN software solutions allow
    users to exclude selected apps from operating through the VPN, but the default settings usually
    direct all traffic through them.&nbsp;

    On the other hand, a web proxy can be accessed directly from the browser and does not require
    software installation. However, the disadvantage is that a web proxy can only open websites and
    can not mask your IP address for other applications on your device. A web proxy is ideal if you
    quickly need to visit a blocked website without downloading any type of software.
